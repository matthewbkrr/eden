# CLAUDE.md — eden

Project rules and conventions for eden, a realtime messenger (text + photos)
built on Elixir/Phoenix. This file holds **project decisions**; low-level
Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView/Ecto coding rules live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and
must also be followed.

## Stack & versions

- **Elixir** `~> 1.19` (local: 1.19.5) on **Erlang/OTP** 29 locally, **OTP 28** in CI
  (the line officially supported by Elixir 1.19 — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **Phoenix** 1.8 · **Phoenix LiveView** 1.1 · **Bandit** HTTP server.
- **Ecto** + **PostgreSQL 16**.
- Realtime via **Phoenix Channels / LiveView** + **Phoenix.PubSub**.
- **Req** for HTTP (never httpoison/tesla/httpc). **No mailer / no email** —
  auth is invite-link based by design (delivery from an overseas VPS to RU
  inboxes is unreliable); never add Swoosh or any email dependency.
- **Tailwind v4** + **esbuild** for assets.
- Media: **`:image`/vix** (bundled libvips, no system dep) for image thumbnails +
  avatar processing. **`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`** (system dependency — in the Docker
  runtime image and the CI test job) for video poster frames + duration, shelled
  out via `System.cmd`. Video tests are tagged `:ffmpeg` and skipped where the
  binary is absent.
- Quality tooling: **credo**, **sobelow**, **dialyxir**, **mix_audit**.

## Architecture

The app is split into bounded **contexts** under `lib/eden/`, with the web layer
under `lib/eden_web/`. The web layer calls contexts; contexts never call the web
layer. Each schema lives in its owning context. (These contexts are the target
design — built incrementally as features land.)

- **Accounts** — users, authentication, profiles. A profile is editable
  `display_name` + `bio` (`profile_changeset`) plus an avatar: the upload is
  processed (center-cropped square JPEG, metadata stripped) and persisted through
  **Storage** as `avatar_key`; `username` stays immutable (it is the login).
- **Chat** — the messaging domain. **Conversations are a first-class entity**, not
  an implicit pair of users:
  - `Conversation` — a thread; the same model backs both 1:1 and group chats.
    **Delete chat** (`delete_conversation/2`) is per-user: it sets the member's
    `left_at` to hide the thread from their list (`list_conversations/1` filters
    `left_at`). For a **1:1**, new activity clears `left_at` so the chat
    re-surfaces (messaging someone back re-opens it); **leaving a group is
    permanent** (`resurface_direct/1` only un-hides non-group threads, and
    `notify_members/1` skips members who left). The mark-left + last-member check
    + GC run in one transaction; when the last member has left the conversation is
    **garbage-collected** — the DB cascades messages/memberships/attachments and
    the orphaned blobs are deleted via the shared `delete_unreferenced_blobs/1`
    (blobs a forward elsewhere still references are spared).
  - `Membership` — join between a `Conversation` and a user (role, joined_at,
    last_read, `left_at` for per-user chat deletion, etc.). A conversation has
    many memberships.
  - `Message` — belongs to a conversation and a sender; carries text and/or one
    `Attachment` (referenced by storage key, see Storage). Lifecycle: **delete for
    me** hides it for one user (`message_deletions` join, filtered out of
    `list_messages/3`); **delete for both** (sender only) soft-deletes via
    `deleted_at`, removing the message for everyone, and cleans up blobs; **forward**
    copies it into another conversation (re-referencing the same blob,
    `forwarded_from_id` for attribution). A `/app/c/:id/m/:message_id` permalink
    deep-links to a message.
  - `Attachment` — one per message, classified by **magic bytes** into a `kind`
    (`image | video | file | audio`), never the client content-type. Images and
    video render inline (image lightbox; in-app `<video>` with a poster + Range
    seeking); anything else is a downloadable file with a sanitized original name.
    The `:media` Oban worker fills the preview asynchronously (image thumbnail, or
    video poster + duration/dimensions via ffmpeg). Per-kind upload caps and a
    decompression-bomb guard are enforced server-side.
  - `Folder` / `FolderMembership` — **per-user, Telegram-style chat folders**: a
    personal grouping of the owner's sidebar that never affects other members.
    `Folder` (name, `position`) is created/renamed/reordered/deleted in Settings;
    `FolderMembership` is the folder↔conversation join (a chat can be in many
    folders). **"All Chats" is virtual** (no row) — movable among the tabs but not
    deletable; its spot is stored per user in `chat_folder_prefs.all_chats_position`
    (`FolderPrefs`, written by `reorder_folders/2` via the `"all"` sentinel).
    `list_conversations/2` takes an optional `folder_id` (the folder is joined on
    `user_id`, so a foreign id yields nothing); `list_folders/1` carries a
    per-folder unread badge. Folder changes broadcast `:folders_changed` on the
    user topic. Left/hidden chats (`left_at`) drop out of folder views; a GC'd
    conversation cascades its folder rows. **Mute is per-user and badge-only**
    (no push/sound exists): `memberships.muted_at` mutes a chat,
    `chat_folders.muted_at` mutes a folder; a chat muted directly or via ANY
    muted folder stops counting toward every folder badge (its own unread stays
    tracked but renders de-emphasized), and un-muting a folder never un-mutes
    directly-muted chats.
  - **Search** (`search/2`) — conversations by participant display name /
    username (or group title) and messages by body, all scoped through the
    user's non-left memberships (deleted/hidden messages never match). Plain
    escaped `ILIKE '%term%'` (min 2 chars, 20 per group) — right-sized for this
    scale; the FTS/pg_trgm upgrade path is documented in issue #12. The sidebar
    search bar renders grouped results; a message result deep-links via the
    permalink (scroll-to + highlight).
  - **Profile visibility is authorized here, not in the web layer:**
    `get_shared_user/2` returns another user only when the scoped user shares a
    conversation with them (otherwise `:not_found`). The chat header reads
    profiles from already-authorized, preloaded memberships.
- **Channels** — the corporate layer (epic #26): a `Channel` (≈ Mattermost team /
  Discord server) groups thematic chat rooms and carries per-user
  `Membership` roles (`owner | admin | member`; the creator becomes owner).
  Authorization mirrors Chat: every function takes a `%Scope{}` and is scoped
  by membership — non-members get `:not_found` (existence not leaked), members
  lacking the required role get `:forbidden`. Channel-scoped events broadcast
  on `channel:<id>` (subscribe only after `get_channel/2`); rail-level changes
  ping each member's `user:<id>:channels` topic with `:channels_changed`.
  Rooms (conversations bound to a channel), invites, and threads land with
  #29–#31.
- **Storage** — file/photo persistence behind an **adapter behaviour**
  (`Eden.Storage.Adapter`). Local disk in dev, object storage (S3-compatible) in
  prod, swappable without touching callers. Callers store only the file **key +
  metadata**, never a concrete storage implementation — chat attachments
  (`Message`) and account avatars (`avatar_key`) both go through it.

## Commands

- `mix setup` — install deps, create & migrate the DB, build assets.
- `mix phx.server` (or `iex -S mix phx.server`) — run the app locally.
- `mix test` — run the suite (auto-creates & migrates the test DB).
- `mix check` — **the full quality gate** (runs in `MIX_ENV=test`):
  `format --check-formatted` → `compile --warnings-as-errors` → `credo --strict`
  → `sobelow --config` → `deps.audit` → `test`.
- `mix dialyzer` — type checking (separate from `mix check`; first run builds the PLT).
- `mix ecto.gen.migration <name>` — create a migration (correct timestamp/conventions).

## Definition of Done

A change is done only when, before opening/merging a PR:

1. **`mix check` is green** locally — this is the gate.
2. **`mix dialyzer` is green** (CI enforces it too).
3. Tests cover the new behavior.
4. The PR template checklist is completed (migrations reversible, no secrets,
   security impact assessed, docs/CLAUDE.md updated if architecture changed).

## Code review priority rubric

Reviewers tag every finding with a priority.

**Block merge (must be resolved):**
- **P0** — security vulnerability, auth/permission bypass, data loss or
  corruption, secret committed, broken/irreversible migration, app crash.
- **P1** — correctness bug, missing tests for core logic, breaking schema/API
  change without a migration path, significant performance regression, violation
  of context boundaries (web ↔ context, cross-context reach-in).

**Non-blocking (comments / suggestions):**
- **P2** — maintainability: naming, structure, minor perf, missing edge-case tests.
- **P3** — style nits, docs wording, subjective preferences.

P0/P1 must be addressed before merge; P2/P3 are advisory.

## Skills (must use)

Skills are vendored in `.claude/skills/` (so they travel with the repo) or come
from installed plugins. Use them as follows — this is **not optional**.

### Elixir/Phoenix code — always consult the thinking skills first

For **any** work that writes or changes Elixir code (`.ex`/`.exs`), invoke the
relevant thinking skill **before** exploring or editing — the skills tell you
what patterns and anti-patterns to look for. The `using-elixir-skills` router
maps the task to the right one:

- `elixir-thinking` — language idioms, structuring modules, pattern matching, `with`.
- `phoenix-thinking` — LiveView/Plug/PubSub, controllers, the mount lifecycle.
- `ecto-thinking` — schemas, changesets, contexts, queries, migrations, preloads.
- `otp-thinking` — GenServer/Supervisor/Task/Registry, concurrency, fault tolerance.

(`oban-thinking` is referenced by the router but not vendored — Oban isn't a
dependency yet; see `.claude/skills/ATTRIBUTION.md`.)

### UI / frontend work — use the design skills

For any UI (LiveView templates, components, HEEx/Tailwind, pages, styling):

- **`frontend-design`** — building new components, pages, or app UI.
- **`impeccable`** — designing, auditing, polishing, or iterating on existing UI
  (typography, color, spacing, motion, accessibility, UX copy).

### Other rules

- Follow the usage rules in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Note: the stock
  `mix precommit` advice there is superseded by **`mix check`** as this project's gate.
- Respect context boundaries and the storage-adapter abstraction described above.

## Deployment (Phase 5)

Production runs as an **OTP release** in a thin Docker image (multi-stage
`Dockerfile`, Erlang/OTP 28 on Debian bookworm — matches CI).

- `bin/server` — start the supervised app (sets `PHX_SERVER=true`).
- `bin/migrate` — run migrations via `Eden.Release.migrate/0` (no Mix in prod).
- `GET /healthz` — liveness probe, answered in the endpoint before the router
  (cheap, no DB), excluded from `force_ssl`.
- Required runtime env (see `config/runtime.exs`): `DATABASE_URL`,
  `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `PHX_HOST`; `EDEN_UPLOADS_ROOT` for the uploads volume;
  `PORT` optional.
- CI's **release-smoke** job builds the prod release and runs migrations through
  it, so prod-only compile/runtime-config regressions are caught before deploy.
- Still server-dependent (do at deploy time): domain + TLS (reverse-proxy),
  Postgres backups, log shipping, prod metrics/alerts.

## Security follow-ups (tracked)

- **Content-Security-Policy** — there is no CSP yet; `Config.CSP` is temporarily
  ignored in `.sobelow-conf`. When the LiveView UI lands, add a nonce-based CSP to
  the `:browser` pipeline and **remove that ignore entry**.
- **S3-compatible storage adapter** — only `Eden.Storage.Local` exists. Prod uses
  it against `EDEN_UPLOADS_ROOT` (a persistent volume, set in `config/runtime.exs`).
  Build an S3 adapter to satisfy Phase 3's "storage swaps by one config line"; it
  needs `local_path/1` to return `:error` so file serving falls back to streaming
  bytes.
- ~~**Attachment blob cleanup on delete**~~ — **resolved** by message "delete for
  both": `delete_message_for_both/2` deletes the `storage_key` + `thumbnail_key`
  blobs (after the tombstone commits, and only if no forwarded copy still
  references them). Any new delete path must do the same.
